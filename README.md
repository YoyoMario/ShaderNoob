# Shader Noob

This project started a new journey for me. Breaking down shader implementation and combining them in the latest step. This technique allows me to comprehend what's going on.

This repository will remain public, to serve others the same purpose if needed.

Inspiration for this shader came from [Cyan's Twitter](https://twitter.com/Cyanilux/status/1124280282285248512) post.
